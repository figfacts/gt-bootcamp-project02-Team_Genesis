  ### Usage

Due to the limited time and challenges we overcome, TraderJocks is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Our plans for future development include: creating a buy/sell/trade button for users to execute transactions among other users, adding filters on the homepage i.e. by category or league so easily sort through the items in the website, and sending auto-generated emails based on the user's interests. 

Users will need to begin by clicking on the "sign up" button to create their TraderJocks account. If a user already has an account, then they can click the "log in" button. Once logged in, the user will be redirected to their specific profile page to view their sports collection. To upload a new item to the user's collection, the user can click on the "add item" button where they will be prompted to enter the details of their item. Once the "submit" button is clicked, then the newly added item will appear in the user's profile.
